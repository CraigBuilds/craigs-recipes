    <h3>Why did I write this book?</h3>
    <p>
      For years I've wanted to bring together all the recipes that I return to again and again, the ones that have
      become staples in my kitchen. ToDo - finish this.
      <br/>
      <b>Food for life</b> isn't just food I've been cooking my whole life, it's food that supports a healthy life,
      that adds to a good life, and that fits into a realistic life.
    </p>
    <h3>How to use this book</h3>
    <p>
      Instead of organizing recipes by course or ingredient, I've grouped them by intention, by what you might be
      craving or needing on any given day. Maybe you want something nourishing, something quick to pull together
      after work, something comforting and familiar, or something special to share and impress.
      <br/>
      Each recipe is scored and color-coded across these different intentions, because our needs rarely fall neatly into
      one category. A meal can be both fast and restorative, or indulgent yet balanced.
      <br/>
      Even though the chapters are organized by the main intention, every recipe in this book is designed to be
      balanced and flexible. The “quick” recipes are still nourishing and satisfying; the “comfort” dishes
      still leave you feeling good afterwards, and they can all be adapted to shift the focus towards another intention.
      There are notes throughout the book on how to do this.
      <br/>
      Nothing here has been hyper-optimized for one goal at the expense of another, and that is what has made these
      recipes staples that I return to again and again.
      <br/>
      ToDo - Add something about high-protein hypertrophy meals, low calories cutting meals, etc.
